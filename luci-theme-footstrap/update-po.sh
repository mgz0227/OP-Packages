# Rescan the theme sources into po/templates/footstrap.pot and merge it into every

#
#   ./update-po.sh            rescan, merge, report what is still untranslated
#   ./update-po.sh --check    change nothing; fail if the .pot is stale or a string is
#                             untranslated. The CI gate.
#
# A missing translation cannot fail loudly — an uncompiled _() falls through to its English msgid
# and nothing reports it — so --check is a gate rather than a suggestion.
#
# The directory is `po/`, which is what LUCI_LANGUAGES globs and what Weblate translates. Naming it
# `i18n/` stops luci.mk emitting a per-language package, which mattered while a self-updater
# resolved the theme by name and took head -1 (issue #6); that updater is retired and owfeed builds
# one artifact per format either way, so the rename only cost the catalogue its visibility to the
# translation platform.
#
# Nothing here runs on the buildbot — luci.mk calls po2lmo itself. This needs perl and gettext,
# which the OpenWrt build does not.
#
# The scanner is LuCI's OWN build/i18n-scan.pl rather than a grep: it lexes a .ut, rewriting the
# template into JS before xgettext, and covers the rpcd acl.d/*.json title. A grep would miss the
# ACL string and choke on any apostrophe.
