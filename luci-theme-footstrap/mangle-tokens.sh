# Rename the PRIVATE `--fs-*` custom properties in a built cascade.css to short names.
#
#   ./mangle-tokens.sh <cascade.css> <reserved-source-dir>...
#
# Run from the package Makefile over $(PKG_BUILD_DIR) only, never over a dev build. The names are
# 16.6% of the sheet and mean nothing to a browser; this is the same trade terser makes for the JS.
# Measured: 135655 -> 123935 bytes, and uhttpd serves /www with no compression, so those are wire
# bytes on every cold load as well as flash bytes.
#
# Why it is safe, each clause checked rather than assumed:
#   * `--fs-*` is the PRIVATE tier. The outbound contract with third-party apps is the `--*-color-*`
#     export tier, a different prefix, and it is not touched. Verified on the router: no installed
#     luci-app reads a `--fs-` name.
#   * The RESERVED set is DERIVED, not listed: every `--fs-` name appearing in the theme's JS or in
#     a .ut template crosses a seam and keeps its name, so a new one cannot be forgotten.
#   * Point the dirs at the SOURCE tree, not at $(PKG_BUILD_DIR): in CI the build tree's JS has
#     already been through terser and its comments are gone, so a name that only appears in a
#     comment stops being reserved and the same source produces a different sheet depending on who
#     built it. Reading the source over-reserves by about a kilobyte, which is the direction that
#     cannot break anything.
#   * The scan is string-aware and reads the WHOLE identifier before deciding: a prefix match would
#     be a silent corruption, `--fs-space-2` being a prefix of `--fs-space-2-5`.
#   * The short names are `--a`…`--z`, `--A`…`--Z`, then `--aa`…. The shortest custom property
#     otherwise present is 5 characters, so a collision is impossible; the script re-checks that
#     rather than trusting it.
#
# What it costs: the SHIPPED sheet is unreadable when debugging on a router. Everything that reads
# the theme's own names runs against an unmangled build, which is why this is a package-build step
# and not part of build-css.sh. Verify a change here with cssdiff.py, mangled against plain.

# --rewrite <dir>… : the seam names are mangled TOO, and the same map is applied to the JS and

#
# The seam is safe to rename only because every `--fs-` reference on the far side is a WHOLE string
# literal — `setProperty('--fs-accent', …)`, never `'--fs-' + role`. Checked across all 89 sites;
# if one is ever composed, this flag renames the CSS and the JS keeps asking for a name that no
# longer exists, silently. The 36 seam names cost 8,574 B in the sheet, `--fs-accent` alone 1,452.
