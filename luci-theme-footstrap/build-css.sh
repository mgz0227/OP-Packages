# Squeeze the whitespace CSS ignores — wire AND flash bytes, since uhttpd does not compress.
#
# Removed (~9.5 KB): the space after `:`, the spaces around `{ } ; ,`, the last `;` of a block, the
# newline after every declaration. lightningcss would save ~13 KB, but its extra 3.5 KB comes from
# rewriting colours and merging rules — transforms that can change behaviour. These cannot.
#
# Left alone, each for a reason:
#   - the single space between selectors: `.a .b` is a DESCENDANT combinator, `.a.b` is not;
#   - spaces inside calc(): required around `*`, `/` and the `-` of `calc(100% - 8px)`;
#   - the LINE BREAK inside a declaration, which is whitespace too — joining lines with nothing
#     between them turns a wrapped calc() into `…))- .004 …`, and a `-` with no space before it is
#     a parse error, so the declaration drops and the token it defined goes undefined, silently —
#     --fs-bg then became invalid at computed-value time and the canvas fell back to white
#     (export-tier.mjs caught it: contrast 1.5:1);
#   - `>` `+` `~` spaces: stripping them is safe but buys only ~200 bytes;
#   - anything inside a string: every data-URI here is quoted and full of `:`, `;` and spaces;
#   - one newline after `}`, so the shipped file stays greppable.
